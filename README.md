## Contributing

We highly value contributions from the community and we strive to make the contributing process as easy and transparent as possible. If you're interested in contributing, please follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository: This creates your own copy of the project where you can make your changes.
2. Create a new branch on your fork: This keeps your changes separate from the main project and makes it easier to merge your changes later.
3. Make your changes: Update the files with the improvements or additions you want to contribute.
4. Commit your changes: Ensure your commit has a clear and descriptive title. This aids others in understanding the purpose of your changes.
5. Push your changes to your fork: This makes your changes visible on GitHub for others to see and review.
6. Open a pull request: This signals us that you're ready for your changes to be reviewed and potentially merged into the main project.

Happy coding!
