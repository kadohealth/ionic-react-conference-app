## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. [Download the installer](https://nodejs.org/) for Node LTS. This project runs on Node.js, and we recommend using the long-term support (LTS) version.
2. Install the Ionic CLI globally using npm (Node Package Manager): `npm install -g ionic`. You'll need this for running Ionic specific commands.
3. Clone this repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-react-conference-app.git`.
4. Navigate to the project root directory and run `npm install` to install all necessary dependencies for the project.
5. Once the installation is complete, run `ionic serve` in a terminal from the project root. This will start a local development server for the application.
6. The application should now be accessible at `http://localhost:8100`. Happy coding! :tada:
